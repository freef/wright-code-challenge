# Matt Freeland Code Challenge for Wright
## Scenario
  On our website, we have a "Back to Top" button that appears in the lower right hand corner of most pages (with some exceptions, e.g. homepage) Implement this component as a vue component from scratch.

## Requirements

-[x] Setup a fresh Laravel 5.5 project for this task using composer (https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/ - note that you will need to do this via the composer create-project method as we are on the previous LTS version)
-[x] Make sure you're using laravel-mix for compiling the JS assets (this is included by default in the laravel install process). See https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix on general setup and usage for mix. Note that Vue is already included in the default package.json file.
-[x] The button should be implemented as a Single-File-Vue-Component, which can be referenced in the blade template as <to-top :props></to-top> (component name for example). Reference resources/assets/js/app.js on how to bootstrap the Vue components
-[x] Implement a test page with block sections and lorem ipsum text, large enough to warrant a scroll to top button. Donâ€™t need to worry about the page styling or structure, just enough content so that the page is tall enough.
-[x] Clicking the fixed-position/floating button should smoothly animate to the top of the page (default easing, configurable duration, ~800ms default)
-[x] The button should automatically hide by default, and show once the user is scrolled 500px down the page (hiding again if user scrolls back above the threshold)
-- [x] Should be a configuration-based threshold on when it shows (default otherwise)
--[] Bonus points for being able to set a px value OR an element selector
-[x] On our modular content pages, the button also switches color dynamically between a light and dark version, depending on the content block underneath it
--[x] Default to .dark, switch to .light when button intersects with an element with .dark class or an element with a .global-footer class
